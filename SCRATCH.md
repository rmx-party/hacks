# DEV SCRATCH NOTES

## TODO:

- import ethers or the modern replacement thing
- with ethers, load in the abi from the contract deploy. think about how to
    automate this push from the contract project in the future
- with the abi loaded, contract transaction should be possible. just a mint,
    shouldn't require special args
- do that twice
- auto estimate the tx lazily
- button to trigger the tx submit, there may not be any confirmation after the
    click
- probably need to instruct users how to fund their wallet for the demo
- show the opensea links upon success

## LEARNINGS

- etherspot docs kinda suck / are missing / wip / hard to follow
- overlooking the docs, it seems like they have some handy components but maybe
    not necessary
-
